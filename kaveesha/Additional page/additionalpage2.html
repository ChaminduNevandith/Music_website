        During the Middle Ages, music became an important part of Christian 
        worship. Gregorian chants, which were sung in Latin and based on 
        the Bible, were the dominant form of music during this period. 
        Other popular forms of music included troubadour songs, which were
        often performed by traveling musicians and poets.
